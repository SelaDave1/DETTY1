    Hi everyone. I am Detty Grandpa. I recently started my journey a couple of weeks ago with the aim of achieving knowledge in web designing.
     Not knowing what to do and where to start, I was introduced to FreeCodeCamp by my lecturer. A site where anyone whether a beginner or someone
     with little or no idea about coding can learn and become a better programmer. Though my journey has been a wonderful one, there were times I faced challenges and I had to consult a friend to help me overcome
     those challenges. Learning to be a programmer is a hectic task but I try to find joy in it and enjoy what I am doing<br>
